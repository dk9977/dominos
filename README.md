# dominos
First, this program identifies dominos in an image.
Second, this program finds the longest chain of dominos that can be made without "doubles" and without repeating number matches.

Run Project_Kempster_Derrick.m from within a recent version of MATLAB.
My Add-Ons include the Computer Vision, Image Acquisition, Images Processing, Signal Processing, and Statistics and Machine Learning Toolboxes.

To change the image analyzed by the program, change line 8 of Project_Kempster_Derrick.m to another one in the smae directory.
